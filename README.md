[cite_start]**AgriConnect is a digital platform designed to empower farmers by providing real-time, easy access to information on government schemes, funding, and resources[cite: 1, 3]. [cite_start]Our mission is to bridge the critical information gap and boost agricultural success[cite: 2].**

### [cite_start]The Challenge: Information Asymmetry in Agriculture [cite: 5]

Today, farmers face significant hurdles in accessing the benefits designed for them. [cite_start]This "information asymmetry" leads to missed opportunities and reduced productivity[cite: 5].

* [cite_start]**Low Awareness:** Only 22% of farmers are aware of the schemes relevant to them[cite: 7].
* [cite_start]**Complex Processes:** Complicated application procedures cause failure rates as high as 80%[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Lost Funds:** A staggering $5 billion in funds go unclaimed annually simply due to a lack of awareness[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Yield Impact:** Delays in receiving crucial information can reduce crop yields by 15-20%[cite: 13].

### [cite_start]Our Solution: AgriConnect - Your Digital Farming "BUDDY" [cite: 16]

[cite_start]AgriConnect is a centralized digital platform that delivers timely and personalized information directly to farmers[cite: 17]. [cite_start]It's available on both web and mobile, ensuring wide accessibility[cite: 24].

### Proven Impact

A pilot study of the AgriConnect platform demonstrated significant positive outcomes:

| Metric | Improvement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Farmer Income Growth** | [cite_start]▲ 25% [cite: 69, 72, 73] |
| **Scheme Participation** | [cite_start]▲ 60% [cite: 70, 75] |
| **Application Error Rate** | [cite_start]▼ 75% [cite: 71, 76, 77] |
| **Adoption of Modern Practices** | [cite_start]▲ 30% [cite: 81, 82] |
| **Dependence on Intermediaries** | [cite_start]▼ 40% [cite: 83, 85] |

[cite_start]Furthermore, the pilot phase enabled **$10 million** in secure funding for farmers[cite: 88].
